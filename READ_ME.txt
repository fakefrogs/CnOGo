//--  Development notes  --//

Basic layout and navigation implemented.

Clicking the "Display Abilities" buttons brings up the display ability screen.
Tapping anywhere on this screen returns to the main character select screen.

Because no gameplay mechanics have been implemented, in order to navigate to
end match screen for testing purposes, ability buttons act as a shortcut.  
Press each ability button in order to access end match screen.
